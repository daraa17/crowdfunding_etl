# Introduction
Our goal with this ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) mini project is to create a smooth process for handling crowdfunding campaign data. Using Python, Pandas, and data transformation methods, we extract information from Excel files, make necessary changes, create CSV files, set up a database structure, and load the data into Postgres.
# Sources of Data
## Within the Resources folder there is:
+ campaign.csv
+ category.csv
+ contacts.csv
# Tools Used
+ Python and Pandas
+ Jupyter Notebook
+ Postgres Database
+ Excel
# Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook to process data and make CSV files.
2. Use the provided crowdfunding database schema file to set up tables in PostgreSQL.
3. Load the CSV files into PostgreSQL tables.
4. Check the database to ensure the data is loaded correctly.
# Conclusion 
In this ETL project, we extracted, transformed, and loaded data from Excel files into a Postgres database. With Python and Pandas, we managed crowdfunding campaign data and created a relational database schema. This project showcases how ETL methods are used in practical data handling and storage situations.
